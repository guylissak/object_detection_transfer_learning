# object_detection_transfer_learning
Object detection transfer learning with PyTorch.
In this project, i've used transfer learning on efficentNetB0 model for bounding box regression.
The project includes a jupyter notebook linked to google collab and python modules folder with the data/ model pre/post proccessing.
The model was trained on a GPU.

## Stack:
PyTorch, Python, google collab, transfer learning, efficentNetB0 model
